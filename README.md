# Ontology RAG

Companies often face challenges in creating ontologies for large knowledge bases. Doing this manually is difficult, time-consuming, and does not scale effectively. This project aims to address these challenges by leveraging Generative AI techniques to automate the creation of ontologies for a given knowledge base.
