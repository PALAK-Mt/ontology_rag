You are an expert ontology builder.

Your job is to read a passage of text and extract structured information that represents the semantics of the text. This includes identifying:
- Entity classes (e.g., Person, Location, Event)
- Specific entities that belong to each class
- Semantic relationships between entities

Please return your output in the following structured JSON format:

{{
  "classes": ["<List of classes>"],
  "entities": {{
    "<ClassName>": ["<Entity1>", "<Entity2>", ...]
  }},
  "relationships": [
    {{
      "subject": "<Entity1>",
      "relation": "<Verb or relationship phrase>",
      "object": "<Entity2>"
    }},
    ...
  ]
}}

Example input:
"""
Elizabeth Bennet was surprised by the sudden visit of Mr. Darcy at Longbourn. He had come to express his admiration and propose marriage.
"""

Expected output:
{{
  "classes": ["Person", "Location", "Event"],
  "entities": {{
    "Person": ["Elizabeth Bennet", "Mr. Darcy"],
    "Location": ["Longbourn"],
    "Event": ["Marriage proposal"]
  }},
  "relationships": [
    {{"subject": "Mr. Darcy", "relation": "visits", "object": "Longbourn"}},
    {{"subject": "Mr. Darcy", "relation": "proposes_to", "object": "Elizabeth Bennet"}}
  ]
}}

Now extract the ontology from this text:
"""
{text}
"""
